# Project Overview

This project is a dynamic dashboard application built with Next.js. The dashboard allows users to add and manage widgets (cards) with ease. Key features include:

1. **Widget Management**: Users can add new widgets to specific categories using a sidebar that appears upon clicking the "Add Widget" button at the top. The sidebar lets users select a category (e.g., CSPM Executive Dashboard, CWPP Dashboard) and then fill in details like the title, description, and image URL.
   
2. **Category-Specific Widgets**: Each widget is associated with a category, and users can manage widgets by category, ensuring organized and accessible content.

3. **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is designed to be fully responsive, with specific layouts for different screen sizes, including mobile.

4. **State Management**: The Context API is used for efficient state management, handling the addition, deletion, and updating of widgets across the application.

5. **User Experience**: Includes features like a cancel option and a cross icon to close the sidebar without disrupting the user experience.
